* **New:** Integrate EmojiCompat for futureproofing emojis on all API versions
* **New:** Build against Android P (SDK 28)
* **New:** Use light nav bar in Marshmallow+
* **New:** Splash screen on startup, for your viewing pleasure.
* **New:** GitHub now scrapes the "trending" page rather than the "most popular repos created in the last week" logic from before. These might be reconciled in the future.
* **New:** Shuffle button in service ordering.
* **Fix:** Fix Medium API often (never?) returning collections information anymore
* **Fix:** A bunch of miscellaneous rare crash cases
* **Under the hood:** Building against AndroidX libraries

## 0.3.5 (2018-03-29)
* **Fix:** Accidental proguard issue that would break HackerNews

## 0.3.4 (2018-03-29)
* **New:** Dribbble is back! This is an unofficial API now via scraping the webpage directly. Let's see how long this lasts.

## 0.3.3 (2018-03-26)
* **Fix:** Paging not working. Sorry for this! Was a super weird issue with the proguard optimization turned on and stripping retrofit service parameters.

## 0.3.2 (2018-03-25)


## 0.3.1 (2018-03-25)
* **Enhancement:** Hacker News stories only show the tag if it's *not* `STORY`, as almost all are `STORY`. Little less noisy
* **Fix:** Crash due to rastered vector drawable pngs being used as vectors at runtime. This was a pretty gnarly issue and weird to track down, sorry for the trouble!
* **Misc:** Goodbye to Dribbble for now, as their v1 API is being shut down this week and the v2 API only allows for content production and management rather than reading feeds. This could return in the future but as an unofficial API.

## 0.3.0 (2018-03-18)
* **New:** You can now reorder services in settings
* **New:** You can now enable/disable services in settings. Note this is WIP and not polished yet.
* **Enhancement:** GitHub is now paginated when there are more results (thanks to [@charlesdurham](https://github.com/charlesdurham)!)
* **Enhancement:** All models have been moved to native kotlin data classes using a new Moshi code gen implementation. Not really a user facing feature, but I'm really proud of it :)
* **Enhancement:** APK size went on a diet! Fully enabled shrinking and APK splits, so now download size is ~4.9MB.
* **Fix:** Medium is now fixed via pointing to the new `/topic/popular` endpoint
* **Fix:** Building with a new version of D8 that should avoid some bizarre VM crashes on some Mediatek devices ಠ_ಠ

## 0.2.2 (2017-12-17)
* Fix pagination not working

## 0.2.1 (2017-12-16)

* **Enhancement:** List items use ConstrainLayout now, which should have better perf (thanks to [@R4md4c](https://github.com/R4md4c)!)

* **Fix:** A small memory leak in image services
