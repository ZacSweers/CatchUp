      "comment": "Hi everyone! [Joe](https://twitter.com/joelallouz) here, with [Kuan](https://twitter.com/kuanluo) and [Eric](http://ericfenny.com). We’re the team that lead product and design for Etsy’s Maker Innovation group, where we build products to help Etsy sellers scale their creative businesses.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of April we launched Etsy’s newest product, [Pattern](https://www.etsy.com/pattern). It is the easiest way to turn your Etsy shop into your very own website. You can choose a theme, buy a custom domain, edit your content and publish your website in minutes. Pattern also integrates with plenty of Etsy tools so you only have to manage inventory, shipping labels, and orders in one place.\r\n\r\nBefore Etsy, Kuan and I worked on a startup called [Grand St.](http://grandst.com) (acquired by Etsy) and Eric worked at Hyperakt.\r\n\r\nWe’ve had a blast researching, designing, and building this product and would love to answer any questions we can from the DN community.\r\n\r\nWe will be here from 10:30 AM - 2:00PM EST. Ask us anything.\r\n",

Different kinds of user research were used at various stages of the Pattern development/design process, so I will break them down here: \r\n\r\n###Beginning - insight-driven researches to validate our hunch of the product idea###\r\nWe went to sellers' homes and asked them their plans to grow their business and challenges, and noticed that time is the scariest resource for our sellers, most of whom juggling 5 things at once. So we positioned Pattern to be the easiest website builder for Etsy sellers possible. \r\n\r\n###During - Usability testings to identify flawed UX flows###\r\nWe worked closely with our in-house research department and conducted a few rounds of 1:1 usability testings to watch how sellers interact with early prototypes and later, live betas. \r\n\r\n###Close to launch - Marketing/communication-focused research###\r\nAs soon as the product feature is close to complete, we worked to make sure our marketing language to be spot-on. So we did a few rounds of 1:1 interviews with sellers to see if they understood what Pattern is/does. \r\n\r\nIn short, we mostly used 1:1 remote/at home interviews throughout the process and targeted different interviews with specific goals. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like more specifics on any of these.

It was important for us to create a UX that does most of the heavy lifting, making the process as painless and automatic for our users as possible.\r\n\r\n• The advantage of selling on Pattern vs solely on Etsy is the ownership you get over your shop and brand.

I am digging the site! \r\nI have a few notes, but I will preface them by saying I love the site, but just went through a portfolio redesign myself and understand how valuable feedback is :)\r\n\r\n1. The images aren't retina ready, so on my macbook everything is blurry which takes away from the portfolio to me. If I scale down the browser it looks fine, but at fullscreen it becomes really distracting.\r\nAlso even when scaled down, your headshot image is always blurry.\r\n\r\n2. The H5 under you headshot is barely readable to me in fullscreen, because of the color. I would recommend #7c7c7c, or #6c6c6c. Both of those colors made it much more readable, but still gray.\r\n\r\n3. Add something to the images to make me want to click them.\r\nwhether thats a hover animation, or something as simple as wrapping them in <a> tags. right now, i have no way to know that clicking does anything.\r\n\r\n4. Inside the case study windows, I would make the Nav background color white.\r\nleave the bottom border, increase the padding a bit (of the nav). \r\nand Add the image inside the window.\r\nI only say this because I don't think the window matches the style of your site that well. primarily because the gray nav wasn't used anywhere else on the site.\r\nAnd I would love to see an image within this window, because I had forgotten what I clicked.\r\n\r\n5. At the bottom, where you have dribbble work, I would make the images reach the edge of the text. It looks like the image container has a bigger left/right margin than the text that says \"More work\". \r\nSo match the grid up, i think it would look a bit better.\r\n\r\n6. Increase the padding between the \"more work\" section and the footer, just by a tad.\r\n\r\nAnyway! Love the site, the blending of the image at the top is great. \r\nKeep it up! hopefully this stuff helps!\r\n\r\n",
