    We run checkDependencies on this project but also run lint individually on subprojects. SO, to
    avoid duplicating reports, we ignore all issues in projects that aren't in /app/src/ dirs.
    路 `^` matches the start of the string.
    路 `(?!.*/app/src/)` is a negative lookahead that ensures that the string does not contain /app/src/.
    路 `.*` matches any character (except for a newline) zero or more times.
    路 `$` matches the end of the string.
