I liked Villanova so much I decided to stay there to study organic chemistry.  Under the direction of Dr. Robert Giuliano, I worked on a thesis project in carbohydrate chemistry which I defended to earn a Master of Science in Chemistry.  By the way, I&amp;#39;m very proud that Villanova won March Madness and are the 2016 NCAA Champions!  Go Wildcats!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From Villanova, I was hired by Arkema in the Additives group, where I was responsible for optimizing organometallic synthetic processes for transfer to pilot plant, for exploring applications development with tin catalysts in polyester resins, and for optimizing processes for tin catalyst synthesis.  I then accepted a position as Scientist at GlaxoSmithKline, where I was responsible for large-scale, preparative synthesis of active pharmaceutical intermediates for internal medicinal chemistry customers.  This transitioned into a more traditional, medicinal chemistry role where I worked on synthesizing pharmaceutical analogs for safety assessment studies.  I feel fortunate that I&amp;#39;ve seen both chemical manufacturing and the pharmaceutical industry up close -- it&amp;#39;s been an interesting experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&amp;#39;m wearing multiple hats for the ACS.  I&amp;#39;m currently volunteering for the &lt;a href=\"http://philadelphia.sites.acs.org/\"&gt;American Chemical Society Philadelphia Section&lt;/a&gt;, where I serve as the Career Services Committee Chairperson.  I&amp;#39;m responsible for establishing a program of networking events and a series of career workshops hosted by the Section as well as a Career Club moderated by our local ACS Career Consultants.  On a national level, I serve the American Chemical Society as a &lt;a href=\"http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/career-services/ccp.html\"&gt;Career Consultant&lt;/a&gt; and Presenter for the &lt;a href=\"http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/career-services/career-pathways.html\"&gt;ACS Career Pathways&lt;/a&gt; series of Career Workshops which you&amp;#39;ll see at ACS National and Regional Meetings.  Additionally, I also serve as a consultant to the ACS Council of Economic and Professional Affairs.  I live outside of Philadelphia with my wife and two sons.  Right now, I am currently teaching my sons an appreciation of such fine Philadelphia cuisine such as soft pretzels and hoagies -- so far they approve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be back at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time to answer your chemistry career questions -- please ask away!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Go Wildcats!  \r\n\r\nFrom Villanova, I was hired by Arkema in the Additives group, where I was responsible for optimizing organometallic synthetic processes for transfer to pilot plant, for exploring applications development with tin catalysts in polyester resins, and for optimizing processes for tin catalyst synthesis.  I then accepted a position as Scientist at GlaxoSmithKline, where I was responsible for large-scale, preparative synthesis of active pharmaceutical intermediates for internal medicinal chemistry customers.  This transitioned into a more traditional, medicinal chemistry role where I worked on synthesizing pharmaceutical analogs for safety assessment studies.  I feel fortunate that I've seen both chemical manufacturing and the pharmaceutical industry up close -- it's been an interesting experience for me.\r\n\r\nRight now, I'm wearing multiple hats for the ACS.  I'm currently volunteering for the [American Chemical Society Philadelphia Section](http://philadelphia.sites.acs.org/), where I serve as the Career Services Committee Chairperson.  I'm responsible for establishing a program of networking events and a series of career workshops hosted by the Section as well as a Career Club moderated by our local ACS Career Consultants.  On a national level, I serve the American Chemical Society as a [Career Consultant]( http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/career-services/ccp.html) and Presenter for the [ACS Career Pathways](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/career-services/career-pathways.html) series of Career Workshops which you'll see at ACS National and Regional Meetings.  Additionally, I also serve as a consultant to the ACS Council of Economic and Professional Affairs.  I live outside of Philadelphia with my wife and two sons.  Right now, I am currently teaching my sons an appreciation of such fine Philadelphia cuisine such as soft pretzels and hoagies -- so far they approve.\r\n\r\n**I'll be back at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time to answer your chemistry career questions -- please ask away!**",

I didn&amp;#39;t tell anyone but my boyfriend and my best friend. The abortion was my choice, I still believe it was right, but it wasn&amp;#39;t what I wanted. My (now ex) boyfriend didn&amp;#39;t have anything to say when we found out I was pregnant. He didn&amp;#39;t have an opinion on how to proceed. He just said it was ultimately my choice so he wouldn&amp;#39;t even bother talking about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t much of a decision. We both have mental health issues which I would never pass on to a child I couldn&amp;#39;t teach to live with them, so adoption was out. And aside from the fact that I&amp;#39;m young and we&amp;#39;re poor and neither of us would make even halfway decent parents, the relationship was too insane. I&amp;#39;m still not sure how much of the nastiness was him being wounded from his past and how much was him being a psychopathic jerk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But more often than not we were both hurt and angry. He belittled me, always accused me of cheating, called me stupid and a slut. But he was trying to be better. And I know I wasn&amp;#39;t easy to be with either. I don&amp;#39;t know how much was borderline abuse and how much was just an unhealthy relationship. Whenever he yelled at me I wound up so confused, unable to get any perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So aside from all of the practical reasons to not have a child. . .I just couldn&amp;#39;t let myself be trapped, tied to him forever. We spoke less and less in the days after we found out. Fought more. But he promised me he&amp;#39;d fight me to the death to be in his kid&amp;#39;s life if I decided to keep the baby. I didn&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;d end up breaking up at the time but I knew I needed to be able to escape him if the relationship got too much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scheduled the procedure, told him the time. I wasn&amp;#39;t even sure he&amp;#39;d show up until I got to the clinic the morning of the appointment. But he did. He sat in the waiting room with me and complained about missing work. Just one or two sentences. Then they called me in and talked to me for awhile. When they called him in for my ultrasound he sat so far away from me the doctor had to tell him several times to move closer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then when the ultrasound was over and the doctor left he got up and walked out without saying anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was early enough along that I got to take a pill. One big one at the office and four more inserted vaginally 24 hours later. I felt my baby die inside me. I don&amp;#39;t know how, or how to describe it, really. But all at once my womb just felt. . .still. Empty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all I wanted was to cry with the one person who would understand just how awful this all was. Why I didn&amp;#39;t want to do it and why I had to. But he never called. He next reached out at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week later he asked me when I was going to come see him. And I told him it was over. I told him he didn&amp;#39;t get to just walk out on me in the middle of an abortion and act like nothing happened. I told him I didn&amp;#39;t want to be with him. That he treated me poorly and I deserved better. And I do believe that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s been a month and every morning I think of what could have been. How far along I&amp;#39;d be. What my life could be like as a mother. I can&amp;#39;t look at little kids or pregnant women. Mother&amp;#39;s Day was so much harder than I expected. And when dealing with this gets hard I want so badly to reach out to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were toxic but we were together for over a year. There were good times, too. I love him. And I miss my friend. The man who, at times, understood me better than anyone else on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. I don&amp;#39;t know how to cope. I don&amp;#39;t know how to get through this. Day to day life doesn&amp;#39;t seem sustainable anymore. This is all I can think about and I&amp;#39;m really worried about falling back into depression. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be so appreciated. I&amp;#39;m sorry this is so long.

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you should know before I tell my stories. First off, I come from a Maternal Navajo line. In case you didn&amp;#39;t know, Navajo women pass their teaching and sacred   medicines onto their daughters and granddaughters. Second, there is only one maternal granddaughter in each generation of our family. Thirdly, I was my grandmothers favorite grandchild. She taught me everything she knew. Lessons that to this day serve me well. When a Grandmother speaks in a Navajo family everyone, and I mean everyone, stops and listens to her. That being said my grandmother produced 1 daughter and 4 sons. Her sons were something else. Ornery and tricksters beyond what you can imagine. My grandmother married an Irish farmer and raised their family on a farm 30 miles outside of a small town on the Utah, Colorado border. They had 15,000 acres of pinto beans and wheat. Their farm bordered the Navajo Nation, of which they visited often. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I was my grandmothers favorite grandchild. I was the only daughter of her only daughter. For whatever reason my mother and grandmother were not close. So my grandmother took to teaching me her old ways. Someone to carry on our traditions and medicines. We would spend summers gathering cedar Berries and making them into protective necklaces. We would gather plants and herbs for teas, make sage bundles, and teaching me how to survive alone on my own out in the Forrest. She poured all her wisdom into me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One summer we had a family reunion. We all decide to stay at my Grandmothers old farmhouse. All my cousins had come and we all decided to stay in the upstairs bedroom. ( that&amp;#39;s a whole story of itself, but we were excited to be together and bravery in numbers right?) Now, the upstairs bedroom in the old farm house had a huge window that over looked the farm. It was 4 foot high, buy 8 foot long. There was a door that opened up to the outside, but no porch or no stairs. If you went out that door you would fall a complete story the ground. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, before it was bedtime my uncle built a huge bonfire and all of us cousins roasted marshmallows. My Grandmother was initially ok with me going out to do this. But she warned me to stay with in the light of the fire and not to wonder off. Now, it was completely pitch black out there. There are no neighbors, no outside lights, and you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to see your hand in front of your face if you had no light source like a flash light or fire. We were all happy roasting our marshmallows and visiting. Then we started to hear coyotes yipping in the distance. My mom and her brothers hearing this started to Howl back. See my mother can mimic any animal noise On the planet. She was calling the coyotes up, because we could hear them getting closer and closer. This is when my grandmother came out and got me. She shushed my mother and her brothers telling them you don&amp;#39;t call out to things in the night. They kinda just laughed it off but continued after my grandmother took me inside. She got me ready for bed, I always slept with my grandmother, I knew I was always safe with her. But this being a special occasion I wanted to sleep upstairs with my cousins. My grandma tried to discourage me from this, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t be swayed, I was too excited. So my grandmother  put my cedar berry necklace on me and we went upstairs and smudged the room I would be sleeping in. She told me if I heard or saw anything to run to her room as fast as I could. She also told me not to be making noises and to be quiet and go straight to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, my cousins and I were all set in beds for the night and we were giggling and talking. I reminded them of what grandma had told me. We shouldn&amp;#39;t be so loud, for something might hear us. My cousin J. laughed it off and said it was just old Indian superstition. He called out and started whistling. This gave me goosebumps. We were never to whistle at night no matter what. Never. We sat and waited a couple of minutes and nothing happened. I breathed a sigh of relief. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of hours later we were all about ready to drift off when my hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. I looked around very, very carefully so that I wouldn&amp;#39;t draw attention. I didn&amp;#39;t see anything, but I could sense it. At first it started quietly. I could hear scratching on the outside of our house. I kept telling myself it was probably just a mountain lion and everything was ok. We were on the second floor so we were safe. But I still had goosebumps and my scalp was crawling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to hear what sound like claws softly crawly up the side of the house. I slowly rolled over to face the window. If something was gonna come in I wanted to see it first, so I could be the first one out of there. I should have gotten up right then and gone to grandma. But I wasn&amp;#39;t a particularly scared child. I thought I could handle what ever it was. It was a few minutes later the door handle on the outside door started to jiggle. At first I was sacred, then I thought, naw, it&amp;#39;s only Uncle Z. You see our Uncle Z was always playing scary tricks on us kids. And I thought for sure it was him. So I kinda chuckled thinking he&amp;#39;s gonna scare my cousins good. So I slowly turn my head and every single one of my cousins eyes were open wide as saucers! This gave me a good giggle. I turned back around toward the window and the door handle was still jiggling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was then that my cousin C asked me to go look and see what it was. I said, ok. I didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to think I was a scary cat. So I got up and tip toed over to the door. I grabbed the door handle firm so whom ever was messing with it couldn&amp;#39;t turn it anymore. I turned around and smiled at my cousins. And everyone single one of them had a sheer look of horror on their face. At the time I thought, Jeez, what a bunch of wimps. Then my cousin J stated to say something, but the thing with J was that he had a bad stutter when he got too excited or scared. He was saying Na Na Na Na na Na.. And he pointed at the window.  I slowly turned around, my hair still standing on end on my neck and arms. An what I saw y&amp;#39;all......... Let me tell you.. I thought my uncle Z had outdone himself on the scary mask this time.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a cows skull with just the eyes barely peeking over the window. Now, our window was open because it was hot. And I was standing right by it. Now, a couple of things hit me all at once. The smell. There was this horrible smell of death. It was so bad I could hear my cousin B gag behind me. There was a cow skull that  had two huge horns on it. Like a Texas Long Horn, but we didn&amp;#39;t have that type of cattle. No one did there. There were  pale animalistic eyes that were staring straight at me. Slowly, very slowly these long bony bloodily fingers made their way over the window seal. But what I couldn&amp;#39;t stop looking at was the cow skull. It was wet, not with water, but with blood and sinew. A smile broke over its face as if it knew I was starting to realize this was not my uncle Z. It opened its maw in a huge smile showing dozens of razor sharp teeth that pointed inward; like a snakes that have teeth like that, so when they eat something whole, it cannot escape back out. The smile cracked its skin when it smiled and this puss like stuff oozed out. Several things happened at once. It reached its hand in toward me, the hand started to instantly smoke, like it was burning. It yanked its hand back out and it gave me a look of our hatred. I instantly thought how wise my Grandmother had been to smudge. Then its long bony finger with huge bloodily claws started moving its finger to call me over to it. It was now smiling again; puss and all. I naturally reached up and held my cedar Berry necklace. It saw this and turned instantly enraged! It let out this vile scream!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!! Immediately, I screamed, Uncle Ziska, Gun, Navajo Wolf. Almost instantly he was barging through our room with his 44 magnum in his tightie whites. He saw it and he blew a hole through the window. The Navajo Wolf jumped and started to run off into the timber. Screaming impossibly loud the entire way. It was enrage it was denied what it had come for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Uncles searched all night for it, planning to kill it, but they never found it. Grandma had me in her arms almost right away. Never again did I leave my grandmother at night. That scream will stay with me until the day I die. Although that was not the last time I heard it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning when we went out side there were huge claw marks down the side of the house. I can&amp;#39;t even begin to imagine what those claws could do to a human body. Thank goodness for my Grandmothers wisdom and preparation. To this day I still have my cedar Berry necklace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A word of advice from grandma. Never, and I mean never call out into the night; because you never know what will answer you back. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It was enrage it was denied what it had come for. \n\nMy Uncles searched all night for it, planning to kill it, but they never found it. Grandma had me in her arms almost right away. Never again did I leave my grandmother at night. That scream will stay with me until the day I die. Although that was not the last time I heard it. \n\nThe next morning when we went out side there were huge claw marks down the side of the house. I can't even begin to imagine what those claws could do to a human body. Thank goodness for my Grandmothers wisdom and preparation. To this day I still have my cedar Berry necklace. \n\nA word of advice from grandma. Never, and I mean never call out into the night; because you never know what will answer you back. ",
