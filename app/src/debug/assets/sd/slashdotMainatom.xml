    <title>Pfizer Blocks The Use Of Its Drugs In Executions</title>

    <summary type="html">HughPickens.com writes: Erik Eckholm reports in the NYT that the
      pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has announced that it has imposed sweeping controls on the
      distribution of its products to ensure that none are used in lethal injections, a step that
      closes off the last remaining open-market source of drugs used in executions. "Pfizer makes
      its products to enhance and save the lives of the patients we serve," the company says, and
      "strongly objects to the use of its products as lethal injections for capital punishment."
      "With Pfizer's announcement, all F.D.A.-approved manufacturers of any potential execution drug
      have now blocked their sale for this purpose," says Maya Foa. "Executing states must now go
      underground if they want to get hold of medicines for use in lethal injection." The mounting
      difficulty in obtaining lethal drugs has already caused states to furtively scramble for
      supplies. Some states have used straw buyers or tried to import drugs from abroad that are not
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration, only to see them seized by federal agents. Other
      states have experimented with new drug combinations, sometimes with disastrous results, such
      as the prolonged execution of Joseph Wood in Arizona in 2014, using the sedative midazolam. A
      few states have adopted the electric chair, firing squad or gas chamber as an alternative if
      lethal drugs are not available. Since Utah chooses to have a death penalty, "we have to have a
      means of carrying it out," said State Representative Paul Ray as he argued last year for
      authorization of the firing squad.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission"

    <title>Nintendo May Start Selling 'Computer Software'</title>
    <link

    <summary type="html">An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Nintendo's most
      recent fiscal-year disclosure made headlines for announcing a release window for the new
      "Nintendo NX" console and yet another Zelda game delay, but it also included news of serious
      corporate restructuring. The short version: Nintendo will soon involve a supervisory committee
      in making top-level executive decisions. A Tuesday announcement included the company's amended
      articles of incorporation, expected to be approved by shareholders this June, and it included
      three new entries in its "business engagement" list: restaurants, medical and health devices,
      and "computer software." The choice of adding "computer software" to that list, on the other
      hand, seems particularly curious -- especially since Nintendo's existing list of engaged
      businesses includes terms that sound very much like computer software, particularly the broad
      term of "contents such as games, images, and music." That list also revised an entry that used
      to say that the company would license the "use or reproduction of copyrighted works" and
      "trademarks." Now, Nintendo will license its "intellectual property rights." That shift to the
      term "intellectual property" includes copyrighted works and trademarks in an umbrella that
      also may include such Nintendo-owned concepts as patents.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

    <summary type="html">An anonymous reader writes: Researchers at Kaspersky have discovered an
      improved version of Backdoor.Win32.Skimer infecting ATM machines worldwide. The new Skimer
      allows criminal access to card data, including PIN numbers, as well as to the actual cash
      located in the machine. The malicious installers use the packer Thermida to disguise the
      Skimer malware which is then installed on the ATM. If the ATM file system is FAT32, the
      malware drops the file netmgr.dll in the folder C:\Windows\System32. If the ATM has an NTFS
      file system, netmgr.dll is placed in the executable file of the NTFS data stream, which makes
      detection and analysis of the malware more difficult. Skimer may lie dormant for months until
      it is activated with the phsyical use of a "magic card," which gives access control to the
      malware, and then offers a list of options that are accessed by inputing a choice on the pin
      pad. The user can then request the ATM to: show installation details, dispense money, start
      collecting the details of inserted cards, print collected card details, self delete, enable
      debug mode, and update. Here's a video of the Skimer malware in action.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

    <title>Google's Tensor Processing Unit Could Advance Moore's Law 7 Years Into The Future</title>

    <summary type="html">An anonymous reader writes from a report via PCWorld: Google says its
      Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) advances machine learning capability by a factor of three
      generations. "TPUs deliver an order of magnitude higher performance per watt than all
      commercially available GPUs and FPGA," said Google CEO Sundar Pichai during the company's I/O
      developer conference on Wednesday. The chips powered the AlphaGo computer that beat Lee Sedol,
      world champion of the game called Go. "We've been running TPUs inside our data centers for
      more than a year, and have found them to deliver an order of magnitude better-optimized
      performance per watt for machine learning. This is roughly equivalent to fast-forwarding
      technology about seven years into the future (three generations of Moore's Law)," said
      Google's blog post. "TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be
      more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors
      per operation. Because of this, we can squeeze more operations per second into the silicon,
      use more sophisticated and powerful machine learning models, and apply these models more
      quickly, so users get more intelligent results more rapidly." The chip is called the Tensor
      Processing Unit because it underpins TensorFlow, the software engine that powers its deep
      learning services under an open-source license.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission"

    <title>Google Turns Firebase Into Its Unified Platform For Mobile Developers</title>
    <link
      href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/16/05/18/2146216/google-turns-firebase-into-its-unified-platform-for-mobile-developers?utm_source=atom1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed"/>
    <summary type="html">An anonymous reader writes: Google has announced a plethora of new features
      to Firebase, its cloud services provider that mobile developers can use to power their apps.
      TechCrunch reports: "In its previous incarnation, Firebase was somewhat similar to Facebook's
      now-defunct Parse in that it offered a database service, user authentication features and
      hosting tools. In this new version, Firebase takes many of Google's existing developer tools,
      like Google Cloud Messaging, and combines them with new and existing Firebase services. With
      this update, Google is turning Firebase into a unified app platform for its now 470,000
      developers on the service (up from 110,000 when it acquired Firebase)." The new Firebase
      features deeply integrated analytics services, allowing developers to track specific parts of
      their apps with fine-grained events. Firebase can build audience segments and allow developers
      to analyze their behavior in even more detail than before, and view how their advertising
      campaigns are performing. With these audience segments, developers can make remote
      configuration changes in apps and take advantage of Firebase's new notifications system. This
      feature is based on Google Cloud Messaging, which is now changing its name to Firebase Cloud
      Messaging. Google is offering all Firebase users free and unlimited notifications with support
      for iOS, Android and the Web. They're also integrating its Cloud Test Lab into Firebase for
      testing mobile apps on real hardware, renaming it the Firebase Test Lab. Other new features
      include crash reporting, the ability to create dynamic deep links into your app, Firebase
      Invites for allowing app users to share referral codes, Firebase App Indexing for bringing app
      content into Google Search, and integration with Google's AdWords and AdMob advertising
      platforms. Last but not least, Google is introducing new pricing plans for Firebase, including
      a new free plan, a fixed-rate plan, and a pay-as-you go plan.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

    <summary type="html">iONiUM quotes a report from Futurism: Research conducted by a team from the
      National Institutes of Health reported a new vulnerable site on HIV for vaccines to target. It
      is based on an antibody from the blood of an HIV-infected patient that binds with the virus
      and also prevents it from infecting a cell. A recent press release reports that a team of
      scientists led by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has discovered a new "weak spot" in
      HIV that vaccines can target. The area, called the fusion peptide, is a simple structure of
      eight amino acids that helps the virus fuse with a cell. According to the study, the team used
      a particularly powerful antibody, called VRC34.01, taken from the blood of an unnamed
      HIV-positive patient that caught the weak spot in the virus. It's not only capable of binding
      with the virus through the fusion peptide but also preventing it from infecting an entire
      cell.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

    <summary type="html">ErnieKey writes: At Google I/O today, the company announced what they are
      calling "Google Daydream." This is their upcoming virtual-reality platform that takes Google
      Cardboard several steps further. Daydream is a platform that will provide guidance for both
      hardware and software developers to create truly immersive Android N compatible VR hardware,
      games and experiences. The first hardware will be available this Fall. Companies such as HTC,
      Samsung, ASUS and others are working on smartphone handsets and VR headsets that are Daydream
      compatible. Game developers like EA and Ubisoft are already working on compatible games.
      Google is also releasing reference devices including a headset and controller to encourage
      developers and companies to develop content for Daydream. In addition to Daydream, Google
      announced Allo, Duo, Instant Apps, and a stable Android N developer preview.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

    <summary type="html">An anonymous reader writes: Alien life in the universe could be close to
      home, swimming around Europa's ocean. The idea has been floating around scientific minds for
      more than a decade: beneath the icy surface of the Jovian moon could slosh a deep, wide ocean
      with the perfect environment for life to develop. In new research published in the journal
      Geophysical Research Letters, NASA scientists studied how the chemical composition of the
      Europan ocean may have evolved and what chemicals it possibly contains, assuming similar
      geochemical processes as on Earth are at play. Europa is thought to possess a rocky core
      fractured with deep cracks that have filled with water. Since the formation of the moon, the
      core has continued to cool, creating more cracks and exposing more rocks to chemical processes
      with this water."We're studying an alien ocean using methods developed to understand the
      movement of energy and nutrients in Earth's own systems," said planetary scientist Steve
      Vance, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. "The cycling of oxygen and
      hydrogen in Europa's ocean will be a major driver for Europa's ocean chemistry and any life
      there, just it is on Earth."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission"

    <title>Spy Chief: Foreign Hackers May Be Targeting Presidential Candidates</title>

    <summary type="html">An anonymous reader writes from a report via NBC News: Director of National
      Intelligence James Clapper warned Wednesday that foreign hackers may be targeting the
      campaigns of U.S. presidential candidates. The FBI and Homeland Security are working with the
      campaigns to tighten security and prevent cyber intruders from penetrating their defenses,
      said Clapper. "We have already had some indications of that, and a combination of DHS, FBI are
      doing what they can to educate both candidates of potential cyber threats," Clapper said,
      without specifying which candidates they were advising. "I anticipate as the campaigns
      intensify we will probably have more of it." A senior U.S. intelligence official told NBC News
      that they are "most worried about Trump, who has no experience with government computer
      systems or protocols." Foreign hacking against American political candidates is nothing new,
      Clapper said. Prior to the 2008 presidential election, Chinese cyber spies had targeted the
      presidential campaigns of then Sen. Obama and Sen. John McCain in order to read emails and
      policy papers. The hackers successfully compromised some emails, including private
      correspondence from McCain, NBC News reported. Also, both Obama's and GOP candidate Mitt
      Romney's campaigns were hit by Chinese cyber-attacks during the 2012 election. The Office of
      the DNI clarified Clapper's remarks tweeting: "We're aware that campaigns and related
      organizations and individuals are targeted by actors with a variety of motivations -- from
      philosophical differences to espionage -- and capabilities -- from defacements to intrusions.
      We defer to FBI for specific incidents."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission"

    <summary type="html">Last month Snapchat was thrown under the bus for a feature that many found
      downright racist. The photo-sharing app had added a face-altering filter that made users look
      like Bob Marley. Less than a month to it, Snapchat is getting blasted over another
      controversial feature. Several users are reporting about a "whitewash" filter that aims to
      "beautify" their looks. Mashable reports: Users of the app have noticed that many of the
      face-altering filters "whitewash." Upset Snapchatters point to the flower crown filter and the
      beautifying filter, both of which seem to lighten skin and eyes and contour the face to make
      one's chin and nose appear smaller. Since the debut, and subsequent popularity, of the
      Coachella-inspired filter, Snapchat users have taken to forums to voice their disproval with
      the app.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

    <title>Google Announces Allo, Duo, Stable Android N Preview, Instant Apps</title>

    <summary type="html">Also at the conference, Google announced Allo, a new smart messaging app,
      and Duo, a high-definition video chat app for Android and iOS devices. TechCrunch reports: Why
      the decision to launch two separate apps? A couple of reasons, it seems. The first is to keep
      the experiences simple and lightweight; and the second: to do something a little different
      from the rest of the pack. Facebook, for example, has supercharged Messenger with smart bots,
      as well as voice and video calling and more on top of its basic text messaging service. Allo
      leverages Google's assistant bot to prompt interesting and relevant responses to texts. Duo is
      a one-to-one video chatting app with a number of interesting features including "Knock Knock"
      which lets you see the real-time video of the person calling you. Google has also released the
      third preview of Android N. The company says that it is now safe enough to be used on your
      primary smartphone and tablet. The new update comes with a feature called "Seamless Updates"
      which will install system updates in the background. The company also announced Instant Apps,
      a feature that will allow users to tap an Instant App URL, and run the app without installing
      it. Clicking on Instant App URL, Google says, only gleans the parts of the app that you need
      for a specific purpose. The feature will work on all phones running Android 4.2 or newer
      version, and will be available starting later this year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

    <title>Google Assistant and Google Home: Amazon Echo, But From Google</title>

    <summary type="html">At its developer conference I/O, Google on Wednesday unveiled Google Home,
      a small round gadget with microphones and speakers that listens and responds to your questions
      and commands. As you may have guessed, Google Home will compete with Amazon Echo. The company
      also announced Assistant. Ars Technica reports: Google's conversational assistant is in the
      same vein as Cortana and Siri, Google Assistant. Google Assistant will be on phones and
      wearables too, and Google says that it will be better at picking out the context of what
      you're doing than any of the competitors. As an example, when standing near Cloud Gate, better
      known as The Bean, in Chicago, you can ask Google Assistant "Who designed this?" Based on your
      location alone, Assistant will understand that you're probably referring to the large shiny
      sculpture in front of you, and answer "Anish Kapoor."The Google Home will be available for
      purchase later this year. CNET has more details.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission"

    <title>Transparent Displays Are Here, But They're Pretty Useless</title>

    <summary type="html">An anonymous reader writes: Samsung has debuted the first commercial
      installation of its 55-inch 'mirror' displays at a salon in South Korea with a transparent
      OLED screen overlaid over a mirrored surface to allow interaction. The Samsung product rivals
      an equivalent TOLED from Planar, with both intended for high-end use in the retail display and
      exhibition space. However both manufacturers are struggling to find practical applications for
      the much-awaited technology. Transparent displays have been a staple of sci-fi films such as
      Minority Report for decades, but only, it seems, because they helped to open up scenes which
      would otherwise have been difficult to film. With the pending advent of AR-based
      visualization, the innovation of the clear monitor seems not only to have come too late, but
      also offer limited practical use, even if its current breathtaking prices were to descend to
      the consumer space.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

    <summary type="html">An anonymous reader writes: Australian engineers have edged closer to the
      theoretical limits of sunlight-to-electricity conversion by photovoltaic cells with a device
      that sets a new world efficiency record. A new solar cell configuration developed by engineers
      at the University of New South Wales has pushed sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency
      to 34.5% -- establishing a new world record for unfocused sunlight and nudging closer to the
      theoretical limits for such a device. The record was set using a 28-cm2 four-junction
      mini-module -- embedded in a prism -- that extracts the maximum energy from sunlight. It does
      this by splitting the incoming rays into four bands, using a hybrid four-junction receiver to
      squeeze even more electricity from each beam of sunlight.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div
