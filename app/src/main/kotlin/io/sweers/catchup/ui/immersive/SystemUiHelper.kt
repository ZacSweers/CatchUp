 * extent to which the System UI's visibility is changed when you call [hide] or [toggle].
 *
 * @param activity The Activity who's system UI should be changed
 * @param level The level of hiding. Should be either [LEVEL_LOW_PROFILE], [LEVEL_HIDE_STATUS_BAR], [LEVEL_LEAN_BACK] or
 * [LEVEL_IMMERSIVE]
 * @param flags Additional options. See [FLAG_LAYOUT_IN_SCREEN_OLDER_DEVICES] and [FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY]
 * @param listener A listener which is called when the system visibility is changed
